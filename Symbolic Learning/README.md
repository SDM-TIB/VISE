##Knowledge Graph
SynLC [1] models lung cancer patient data. Each patient has the following attributes:

Age category
Sex
Smoking habit
Comorbidities
Biomarkers
Drugs taken
Relapse
The attribute values are assigned at random. Hence, no patterns within real lung cancer patients can be observed. Alongside a generator for synthetic lung cancer data, there are already generated datasets modeling 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 patients, respectively. The following files are part of this SynthLC entry.

SynLC RDF: The 1k, 10k, and 100k dataset in RDF.
SynLC Shapes: 25 SHACL shapes consisting of biomarker, drug, and relapse combinations. There are two variants, one is using SPARQL constraints while the other uses a non-standard approach for specifying the shapes target via query.
