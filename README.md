# VISE:  Validated and Invalidated Symbolic Explanations for Knowledge Graph Integrity

VISE represents a novel hybrid strategy that integrates symbolic learning, 
constraint validation, and numerical learning approaches. VISE employs KGE 
to capture implicit information and represent negation in KGs, thereby 
enhancing the prediction performance of numerical models. The experimental 
results demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid technique, which effectively 
integrates the strengths of symbolic, numerical, and constraint validation 
paradigms.
